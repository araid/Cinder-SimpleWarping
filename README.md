Cinder-SimpleWarping
====================

Simple perspective Warping Block for Cinder that doesn't depend on OpenCV.

Uses a technique taken from [glfx.js](https://github.com/evanw/glfx.js), originally from the [Java Advanced Imaging library](http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E17802_01/products/products/java-media/jai/forDevelopers/jai-apidocs/javax/media/jai/PerspectiveTransform.html)

For more robust and complex warping use Paul Houx's great [Cinder-Warping](https://github.com/araid/Cinder-Warping) block.

### Todo
- Add save/load
- Add sample for multiple warps at the same time
